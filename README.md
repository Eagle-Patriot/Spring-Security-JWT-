# Spring Boot with Spring Security and JWT

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Spring Security** in a Spring Boot application using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for securing REST APIs. It includes user authentication and authorization, where JWT tokens are issued to users upon successful login and used for subsequent API requests.

### Key Features:
- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login and protected endpoints based on user roles.
- **JWT Integration**: Generate and validate JWT tokens for stateless security across the application.
- **Spring Security Configuration**: Custom security configuration with filter chains for JWT processing.
- **Exception Handling**: Custom error handling for security-related issues such as invalid credentials or token expiration.
  
### Technologies Used:
- **Spring Boot**
- **Spring Security**
- **JWT**
- **Hibernate** / **JPA** (for database interaction)
- **PostgreSQL** (or any other preferred database)

This project serves as a template for integrating JWT-based security in Spring Boot applications with ease and flexibility.
